# discord_bot
Made a discord bot that connects to servers of my choice, and when mentioned will send information about Alec's (a friend) valorant stats! Cause why not ahahaha.

Note : I used 'pip' to install a few of the modules needed for this py script, namely 'requests', 'discord', 'bs4' and 'python_dotenv'.

How to use :
Ensure the .py and .env file are in the same directory and run the swoofbot.py script in the command line. If successful, you should see a message telling you that swoof bot has connected to discord. From this point, you can interact with the bot directly in the discord server. Lastly, only I have the say in adding the bot to certain servers or not, so if you would also like to track Alec's match history, tell me and I can add it to your server!
